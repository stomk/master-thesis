abstract = {The sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key experimental tool for biomedical research. Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism.},

abstract = {The study of insect satellite DNAs (satDNAs) indicates the evolutionary conservation of certain features despite their sequence heterogeneity. Such features can include total length, monomer length, motifs, particular regions and/or secondary and tertiary structures. satDNAs may act as protein-binding sites, structural domains or sites for epigenetic modifications. The selective constraints in the evolution of satDNAs may be due to the satDNA sequence interaction with specific proteins important in heterochromatin formation and possible a role in controlling gene expression. The transcription of satDNA has been described in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. In insects, differential satDNA expression has been observed in different cells, developmental stages, sex and caste of the individuals. These transcription differences may suggest their involvement in gene-regulation processes. In addition, the satDNA or its transcripts appear to be involved in heterochromatin formation and in chromatin-elimination processes. The importance of transposable elements to insect satDNA is shown by their presence as a constituent of satDNA in several species of insects (including possible active elements). In addition, they may be involved in the formation of centromeres and telomeres and in the homogenization and expansion of satDNA.},

abstract = {The chromosomal distribution of sequences homologous to 18 coned alpha satellite fragments was established by in situ hybridization. It appeared that all the cloned sequences were members of small repeated families located on single chromosome pairs. Among the sequences studied specific molecular markers for chromosomes 3, 4, 10, 11, 17, 18 and X were found. Comparison of the hybridization spectra obtained under non-stringent conditions and of restriction site periodicities in different chromosome-specific families allowed the identification of three "suprachromosomal" families, each located on a characteristic set of chromosomes. The three families together cover all the autosomes and the X chromosome. These data plus those reported previously allow part of the phylogenetic tree of chromosome-specific alpha satellite repeats to be drawn. Each suprachromosomal family has presumably originated from a distinct ancestral sequence and consists of certain types of monomers. Ancestral sequences have evolved into a number of chromosome-specific families by cycles of interchromosomal transfers and subsequent amplification events. The high homogeneity of chromosome-specific families may be a result of intrachromosomal homogenization of amplification units in chromosome-specific alpha satellite domains.},

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, biotinylated pSP12-1 is highly specific for chromosome 12 and has been used to confirm an i(12p) in a case of Pallister-Killian syndrome, both in metaphase spreads and in interphase nuclei. A dominant DNA polymorphism for the centromeric D12Z3 locus is detected with the enzyme TaqI. In addition, a high frequency of D12Z3 array length polymorphisms can be detected using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The D12Z3 array has been measured by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to span approximately 2,250-4,300 kb at the centromeric region of chromosome 12.},

The size and type of extra chromosomes varied among cells of the same individual. A collection of minichromosomes derived from the chromosome type breakage-fusion-bridge cycle was examined for the presence of stable dicentric chromosomes. Six of 23 chromosomes in the collection contained two regions with DNA sequences typical of centromeres. Functional analysis and immunolabeling of CENH3, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, revealed only one functional centromere per chromosome, despite the duplicate centromere sequences. One plant was found with an inactive B centromere that had been translocated to the short arm of chromosome 9. The translocated centromere region appeared identical to that of a normal B chromosome. The inactivation of the centromeres was stable for at least four generations. By using dicentrics from dispensable chromosomes, centromere inactivation was found to be quite common under these circumstances.},

This epigenetic system can result in the conversion of a nonfunctional centromere to a functional one without changes in the content, structural arrangement, or chemical modification state of the minichromosomal DNA. The conversion from a centromere-inactive to an active state, which is evident with minichromosomes carrying abbreviated centromeric DNA constructions, occurs with a relatively high frequency during mitotic cell divisions and readily provides an in vivo assay for proper centromere formation. The centromere-targeted epigenetic system supports a model for centromere function that involves specific de novo folding of centromeric components into a higher order chromatin structure.},

abstract = {'Orang-utan' is derived from a Malay term meaning 'man of the forest' and aptly describes the southeast Asian great apes native to Sumatra and Borneo. The orang-utan species, Pongo abelii (Sumatran) and Pongo pygmaeus (Bornean), are the most phylogenetically distant great apes from humans, thereby providing an informative perspective on hominid evolution. Here we present a Sumatran orang-utan draft genome assembly and short read sequence data from five Sumatran and five Bornean orang-utan genomes. Our analyses reveal that, compared to other primates, the orang-utan genome has many unique features. Structural evolution of the orang-utan genome has proceeded much more slowly than other great apes, evidenced by fewer rearrangements, less segmental duplication, a lower rate of gene family turnover and surprisingly quiescent Alu repeats, which have played a major role in restructuring other primate genomes. We also describe a primate polymorphic neocentromere, found in both Pongo species, emphasizing the gradual evolution of orang-utan genome structure. Orang-utans have extremely low energy usage for a eutherian mammal, far lower than their hominid relatives. Adding their genome to the repertoire of sequenced primates illuminates new signals of positive selection in several pathways including glycolipid metabolism. From the population perspective, both Pongo species are deeply diverse; however, Sumatran individuals possess greater diversity than their Bornean counterparts, and more species-specific variation. Our estimate of Bornean/Sumatran speciation time, 400,000 years ago, is more recent than most previous studies and underscores the complexity of the orang-utan speciation process. Despite a smaller modern census population size, the Sumatran effective population size (N(e)) expanded exponentially relative to the ancestral N(e) after the split, while Bornean N(e) declined over the same period. Overall, the resources and analyses presented here offer new opportunities in evolutionary genomics, insights into hominid biology, and an extensive database of variation for conservation efforts.},

abstract = {The centromere is essential for faithful chromosome segregation by providing the site for kinetochore assembly. Although the role of the centromere is conserved throughout evolution, the DNA sequences associated with centromere regions are highly divergent among species and it remains to be determined how centromere DNA directs kinetochore formation. Despite the active use of chicken DT40 cells in studies of chromosome segregation, the sequence of the chicken centromere was unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of chicken centromere DNA which revealed unique features of chicken centromeres compared with previously studied vertebrates. Centromere DNA sequences from the chicken macrochromosomes, with the exception of chromosome 5, contain chromosome-specific homogenous tandem repetitive arrays that span several hundred kilobases. In contrast, the centromeres of chromosomes 5, 27, and Z do not contain tandem repetitive sequences and span non-tandem-repetitive sequences of only approximately 30 kb. To test the function of these centromere sequences, we conditionally removed the centromere from the Z chromosome using genetic engineering and have shown that that the non-tandem-repeat sequence of chromosome Z is a functional centromere.},

abstract = {Advances in modern sequencing technologies allow us to generate sufficient data to analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes from a single machine in a single day. This potential for sequencing massive numbers of genomes calls for fully automated methods to produce high-quality assemblies and variant calls. We introduce Pilon, a fully automated, all-in-one tool for correcting draft assemblies and calling sequence variants of multiple sizes, including very large insertions and deletions. Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3-5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains. Pilon is freely available as open source software.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

abstract = {Centromere formation is a complex process that involves the packaging of DNA into a centromere-unique chromatin, chemical modification and the seeding of kinetochore and associated proteins. The early steps in this process, in which a chromosomal region is marked for centromerization (that is, to become resolutely committed to centromere formation), are unusual in that they can apparently occur in a DNA-sequence-independent manner. Current evidence indicates the involvement of epigenetic influences in these early steps. A number of epigenetic mechanisms that can affect centromere chromatin organization have been proposed. Here, the characteristics of these mechanisms and their relative roles as possible primary triggers for centromerization are discussed in the light of recent data.},

@article{Piras2010,
abstract = {In a previous study, we showed that centromere repositioning, that is the shift along the chromosome of the centromeric function without DNA sequence rearrangement, has occurred frequently during the evolution of the genus Equus. In this work, the analysis of the chromosomal distribution of satellite tandem repeats in Equus caballus, E. asinus, E. grevyi, and E. burchelli highlighted two atypical features: 1) several centromeres, including the previously described evolutionary new centromeres (ENCs), seem to be devoid of satellite DNA, and 2) satellite repeats are often present at non-centromeric termini, probably corresponding to relics of ancestral now inactive centromeres. Immuno-FISH experiments using satellite DNA and antibodies against the kinetochore protein CENP-A demonstrated that satellite-less primary constrictions are actually endowed with centromeric function. The phylogenetic reconstruction of centromere repositioning events demonstrates that the acquisition of satellite DNA occurs after the formation of the centromere during evolution and that centromeres can function over millions of years and many generations without detectable satellite DNA. The rapidly evolving Equus species gave us the opportunity to identify different intermediate steps along the full maturation of ENCs.},

abstract = {Background: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. Results: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. Conclusion: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

Our method uses the longest reads as seeds to recruit all other reads for construction of highly accurate preassembled reads through a directed acyclic graph–based consensus procedure, which we follow with assembly using off-the-shelf long-read assemblers. In contrast to hybrid approaches, HGAP does not require highly accurate raw reads for error correction. We demonstrate efficient genome assembly for several microorganisms using as few as three SMRT Cell zero- mode waveguide arrays of sequencing and for BACs using just one SMRT Cell. Long repeat regions can be successfully resolved with this workflow. We also describe a consensus algorithm that incorporates SMRT sequencing primary quality values to produce de novo genome sequence exceeding 99.999{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {The ancestral centromeres of maize contain long stretches of the tandemly arranged CentC repeat. The abundance of tandem DNA repeats and centromeric retrotransposons (CR) has presented a significant challenge to completely assembling centromeres using traditional sequencing methods. Here, we report a nearly complete assembly of the 1.85 Mb maize centromere 10 from inbred B73 using PacBio technology and BACs fromthe reference genome project. The error rates estimated fromoverlapping BAC sequences are 7 × 10−6 and 5 × 10−5 for mismatches and indels, respectively. The number of gaps in the region covered by the reassembly was reduced from 140 in the reference genome to three. Three expressed genes are located between 92 and 477 kb from the inferred ancestral CentC cluster, which lies within the region of highest centromeric repeat density. The improved assembly increased the count of full-length CR from 5 to 55 and revealed a 22.7 kb segmental duplication that occurred approximately 121,000 years ago. Our analysis provides evidence of frequent recombination events in the form of partial retrotransposons, deletions within retrotransposons, chimeric retrotransposons, segmental duplications including higher order CentC repeats, a deleted CentC monomer, centromere-proximal inversions, and insertion of mitochondrial sequences. Double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair is the most plausible mechanism for these events and may be the major driver of centromere repeat evolution and diversity. In many cases examined here, DSB repair appears to be mediated by microhomology, suggesting that tandem repeats may have evolved to efficiently repair frequent DSBs in centromeres.},

@article{Ghodsi2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clustering is a fundamental operation in the analysis of biological sequence data. New DNA sequencing technologies have dramatically increased the rate at which we can generate data, resulting in datasets that cannot be efficiently analyzed by traditional clustering methods.This is particularly true in the context of taxonomic profiling of microbial communities through direct sequencing of phylogenetic markers (e.g. 16S rRNA) - the domain that motivated the work described in this paper. Many analysis approaches rely on an initial clustering step aimed at identifying sequences that belong to the same operational taxonomic unit (OTU). When defining OTUs (which have no universally accepted definition), scientists must balance a trade-off between computational efficiency and biological accuracy, as accurately estimating an environment's phylogenetic composition requires computationally-intensive analyses. We propose that efficient and mathematically well defined clustering methods can benefit existing taxonomic profiling approaches in two ways: (i) the resulting clusters can be substituted for OTUs in certain applications; and (ii) the clustering effectively reduces the size of the data-sets that need to be analyzed by complex phylogenetic pipelines (e.g., only one sequence per cluster needs to be provided to downstream analyses).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To address the challenges outlined above, we developed DNACLUST, a fast clustering tool specifically designed for clustering highly-similar DNA sequences.Given a set of sequences and a sequence similarity threshold, DNACLUST creates clusters whose radius is guaranteed not to exceed the specified threshold. Underlying DNACLUST is a greedy clustering strategy that owes its performance to novel sequence alignment and k-mer based filtering algorithms.DNACLUST can also produce multiple sequence alignments for every cluster, allowing users to manually inspect clustering results, and enabling more detailed analyses of the clustered data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We compare DNACLUST to two popular clustering tools: CD-HIT and UCLUST. We show that DNACLUST is about an order of magnitude faster than CD-HIT and UCLUST (exact mode) and comparable in speed to UCLUST (approximate mode). The performance of DNACLUST improves as the similarity threshold is increased (tight clusters) making it well suited for rapidly removing duplicates and near-duplicates from a dataset, thereby reducing the size of the data being analyzed through more elaborate approaches.},

abstract = {The SU(VAR)3-9 protein family was first identified in animals as heterochromatin-associated proteins and found to control establishment of heterochromatic chromatin domains by histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. In Arabidopsis ten SU(VAR)3-9 homologous SUVH genes are found where SUVH1, SUVH2 and SUVH4 represent different subgroups of genes. Also the SUVH1, SUVH2 and SUVH4 proteins represent heterochromatin-associated proteins and display differential effects on control of heterochromatic histone methylation marks. In Arabidopsis the heterochromatin specific histone methylation marks are mono- and dimethyl H3K9, mono- and dimethyl H3K27 and monomethyl H4K20. In contrast to animal systems trimethyl H3K9, trimethyl H3K27 and di- and trimethyl H4K20 do not index chromocenter heterochromatin in Arabidopsis. SUVH2 shows a central role in control of heterochromatin formation and heterochromatic gene silencing in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function of SUVH2 results in significant reduction of all heterochromatin-specific histone methylation marks and causes DNA hypomethylation at chromocenter heterochromatin. SUVH2 overexpression leads to ectopic heterochromatisation accompanied with significant growth defects. SUVH2 shows strong dosage-dependent effects on transcriptional gene silencing. In Arabidopsis different experimental systems connected with transcriptional gene silencing have been used for genetic dissection of molecular mechanisms controlling epigenetic processes. Molecular analysis of the genes identified by the isolated modifier mutants suggests that transcriptional gene silencing in plants is caused by heterochromatisation. A new efficient experimental system for the analysis of transcriptional gene silencing has been established with the help of LUCIFERASE transgene repeats. The different lines established show either complete or partial silencing of the luciferase transgene repeats. These lines have been successfully used either for mutant isolation or for functional analysis of SUVH proteins in control of heterochromatic gene silencing. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

We demonstrate the quality of this approach by assembling new reference sequences for three heterozygous samples, including an F1 hybrid of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the widely cultivated V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, and the coral fungus Clavicorona pyxidata that have challenged short-read assembly approaches. The FALCON-based assemblies were substantially more contiguous and complete than alternate short or long-read approaches.

abstract = {Post-translational histone modifications regulate epigenetic switching between different chromatin states. Distinct histone modifications, such as acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation, define different functional chromatin domains, and often do so in a combinatorial fashion. The centromere is a unique chromosomal locus that mediates multiple segregation functions, including kinetochore formation, spindle-mediated movements, sister cohesion and a mitotic checkpoint. Centromeric (CEN) chromatin is embedded in heterochromatin and contains blocks of histone H3 nucleosomes interspersed with blocks of CENP-A nucleosomes, the histone H3 variant that provides a structural and functional foundation for the kinetochore. Here, we demonstrate that the spectrum of histone modifications present in human and Drosophila melanogaster CEN chromatin is distinct from that of both euchromatin and flanking heterochromatin. We speculate that this distinct modification pattern contributes to the unique domain organization and three-dimensional structure of centromeric regions, and/or to the epigenetic information that determines centromere identity.},

@article{Lermontova2015,
abstract = {Centromeres are chromatin structures required for the proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. The centromere is composed of centromeric DNA, often enriched in satellite repeats, and kinetochore complex proteins. To date, over 100 kinetochore components have been identified in different eukaryotes. Kinetochore assembly begins with the incorporation of centromeric histone H3 variant CENH3 into centromeric nucleosomes. Protein components of the kinetochore are either present at centromeres throughout the cell cycle or localize to centromeres transiently, only prior to the attachment of microtubules to each kinetochore in prometaphase of mitotic cells. This is the case for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins in animal cells. The SAC complex ensures an equal separation of chromosomes between daughter nuclei by preventing the anaphase onset before metaphase is complete, i.e., the sister kinetochores of all chromosomes are attached to spindle fibers from opposite poles. In this review we focus on the organization of centromeric DNA and the kinetochore assembly in plants. We summarize recent advances on the loading of CENH3 into the centromere, subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions of A. thaliana proteins involved in the kinetochore assembly and function. We describe the transcriptional activity of corresponding genes based on in silico analysis of their promoters and cell-cycle-dependent expression. Additionally, barley homologues of all selected A. thaliana proteins have been identified in silico and their sequences and domain structures are presented. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Alpha satellite is a tandemly organized type of repetitive DNA that comprises 5{\%} of the genome and is found at all human centromeres. A defined number of 171-bp monomers are organized into chromosome-specific higher-order repeats (HORs) that are reiterated thousands of times. At least half of all human chromosomes have two or more distinct HOR alpha satellite arrays within their centromere regions. We previously showed that the two alpha satellite arrays of Homo sapiens Chromosome 17 (HSA17), D17Z1 and D17Z1-B, behave as centromeric epialleles, that is, the centromere, defined by chromatin containing the centromeric histone variant CENPA and recruitment of other centromere proteins, can form at either D17Z1 or D17Z1-B. Some individuals in the human population are functional heterozygotes in that D17Z1 is the active centromere on one homolog and D17Z1-B is active on the other. In this study, we aimed to understand the molecular basis for how centromere location is determined on HSA17. Specifically, we focused on D17Z1 genomic variation as a driver of epiallele formation. We found that D17Z1 arrays that are predominantly composed of HOR size and sequence variants were functionally less competent. They either recruited decreased amounts of the centromere-specific histone variant CENPA and the HSA17 was mitotically unstable, or alternatively, the centromere was assembled at D17Z1-B and the HSA17 was stable. Our study demonstrates that genomic variation within highly repetitive, noncoding DNA of human centromere regions has a pronounced impact on genome stability and basic chromosomal function.},

The tandem repetitive nature of this DNA family lends itself to examination by PFGE using restriction enzymes that cleave frequently in unique sequence DNA but which cut only rarely within the repetitive ??-satellite array. Several such restriction enzymes (BglI, BglII, KpnI, ScaI) have proven highly informative in sizing the ??-satellite array and in following the segregation of individual X-chromosome centromeres using PFGE polymorphisms. Among 29 different X chromosomes, ??-satellite array length varied between 1380 and 3730 kb (mean = 2895 kb; SD = 537). In three large CEPH families comprising 24 meioses, inheritance of these PFGE polymorphisms was strictly Mendelian, with no indication of intraarray recombination. Such DXZ1 ??-satellite polymorphisms, therefore, may prove useful in the study of pericentromeric X-linked disorders. ?? 1990.},

Although some chromosomes exhibit extreme characteristics in terms of length, gene content, repeat content and fraction segmentally duplicated, chromosome 8 is distinctly typical in character, being very close to the genome median in each of these aspects. This work describes a finished sequence and gene catalogue for the chromosome, which represents just over 5{\%} of the euchromatic human genome. A unique feature of the chromosome is a vast region of approximately 15 megabases on distal 8p that appears to have a strikingly high mutation rate, which has accelerated in the hominids relative to other sequenced mammals. This fast-evolving region contains a number of genes related to innate immunity and the nervous system, including loci that appear to be under positive selection--these include the major defensin (DEF) gene cluster and MCPH1, a gene that may have contributed to the evolution of expanded brain size in the great apes. The data from chromosome 8 should allow a better understanding of both normal and disease biology and genome evolution.},

The AT-rich repeats can be further subdivided into two subgroups which differ by about 10{\%} of 185 bp in the repeating unit. The chromosomal location of these sequences and the moderately repetitive 5S rDNA sequences was determined in two diploid zebrafish cell lines using in-situ hybridization with fluorochrome-labeled probes. The AT-rich sequences were found at the centromeres of all chromosome pairs and the GC-rich sequences were found in paracentromeric location on over half of the chromosomal pairs. Different patterns of hybridization were found for the two subgroups of the AT-rich family. One type hybridized primarily to centromeres of one half to two thirds of the chromosomal pairs and the other type to centromeres of about three fourths of the chromosomal pairs. The pattern of hybridization with the GC-rich sequences varied somewhat between the cell lines consistent with interindividual variation in the location of paracentromeric heterochromatin. The 5S rRNA genes are found on the long arm of chromosome 3. Most of this chromosome arm is late replicating, but apparently does not contain either the AT-rich or GC-rich repetitive sequences.},

abstract = {Human centromeres are defined by megabases of homogenous alpha-satellite DNA arrays that are packaged into specialized chromatin marked by the centromeric histone variant, centromeric protein A (CENP-A). Although most human chromosomes have a single higher-order repeat (HOR) array of alpha satellites, several chromosomes have more than one HOR array. Homo sapiens chromosome 17 (HSA17) has two juxtaposed HOR arrays, D17Z1 and D17Z1-B. Only D17Z1 has been linked to CENP-A chromatin assembly. Here, we use human artificial chromosome assembly assays to show that both D17Z1 and D17Z1-B can support de novo centromere assembly independently. We extend these in vitro studies and demonstrate, using immunostaining and chromatin analyses, that in human cells the centromere can be assembled at D17Z1 or D17Z1-B. Intriguingly, some humans are functional heterozygotes, meaning that CENP-A is located at a different HOR array on the two HSA17 homologs. The site of CENP-A assembly on HSA17 is stable and is transmitted through meiosis, as evidenced by inheritance of CENP-A location through multigenerational families. Differences in histone modifications are not linked clearly with active and inactive D17Z1 and D17Z1-B arrays; however, we detect a correlation between the presence of variant repeat units of D17Z1 and CENP-A assembly at the opposite array, D17Z1-B. Our studies reveal the presence of centromeric epialleles on an endogenous human chromosome and suggest genomic complexities underlying the mechanisms that determine centromere identity in humans.},

abstract = {The southern and northern Japanese populations of the medaka fish provide useful tools to gain insights into the comparative genomics and speciation of vertebrates, because they can breed to produce healthy and fertile offspring despite their highly divergent genetic backgrounds compared with those of human-chimpanzee. Comparative genomics analysis has suggested that such large genetic differences between the two populations are caused by higher molecular evolutionary rates among the medakas than those of the hominids. The argument, however, was based on the assumption that the two Japanese populations diverged approximately at the same time (4.0-4.7 Myr ago) as the human-chimpanzee lineage (5.0-6.0 Myr ago). This can be misleading, because the divergence time of the two populations was calculated based on estimated, extremely higher molecular evolutionary rates of other fishes with an implicit assumption of a global molecular clock. Here we show that our estimate, based on a Bayesian relaxed molecular-clock analysis of whole mitogenome sequences from 72 ray-finned fishes (including 14 medakas), is about four times older than that of the previous study (18 Myr). This remarkably older estimate can be reconciled with the vicariant events of the Japanese archipelago, and the resulting rates of molecular evolution are almost identical between the medaka and hominid lineages. Our results further highlight the fact that reproductive isolation may not evolve despite a long period of geographical isolation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The centromere is the specialized locus required for correct chromosome segregation during cell division. The DNA of most eukaryotic centromeres is composed of extended arrays of tandem repeats (satellite DNA). In the horse, we previously showed that, although the centromere of chromosome 11 is completely devoid of tandem repeat arrays, all other centromeres are characterized by the presence of satellite DNA. We isolated three horse satellite DNA sequences (37cen, 2P1 and EC137) and described their chromosomal localization in four species of the genus Equus.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the work presented here, using the ChIP-seq methodology, we showed that, in the horse, the 37cen satellite binds CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone-H3 variant. The 37cen sequence bound by CENP-A is GC-rich with 221 bp units organized in a head-to-tail fashion. The physical interaction of CENP-A with 37cen was confirmed through slot blot experiments. Immuno-FISH on stretched chromosomes and chromatin fibres demonstrated that the extension of satellite DNA stretches is variable and is not related to the organization of CENP-A binding domains. Finally, we proved that the centromeric satellite 37cen is transcriptionally active.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our data offer new insights into the organization of horse centromeres. Although three different satellite DNA families are cytogenetically located at centromeres, only the 37cen family is associated to the centromeric function. Moreover, similarly to other species, CENP-A binding domains are variable in size. The transcriptional competence of the 37cen satellite that we observed adds new evidence to the hypothesis that centromeric transcripts may be required for centromere function.},

abstract = {Despite its importance in cell biology and evolution, the centromere has remained the final frontier in genome assembly and annotation due to its complex repeat structure. However, isolation and characterization of the centromeric repeats from newly sequenced species are necessary for a complete understanding of genome evolution and function. In recent years, various genomes have been sequenced, but the characterization of the corresponding centromeric DNA has lagged behind. Here, we present a computational method (RepeatNet) to systematically identify higher-order repeat structures from unassembled whole-genome shotgun sequence and test whether these sequence elements correspond to functional centromeric sequences. We analyzed genome datasets from six species of mammals representing the diversity of the mammalian lineage, namely, horse, dog, elephant, armadillo, opossum, and platypus. We define candidate monomer satellite repeats and demonstrate centromeric localization for five of the six genomes. Our analysis revealed the greatest diversity of centromeric sequences in horse and dog in contrast to elephant and armadillo, which showed high-centromeric sequence homogeneity. We could not isolate centromeric sequences within the platypus genome, suggesting that centromeres in platypus are not enriched in satellite DNA. Our method can be applied to the characterization of thousands of other vertebrate genomes anticipated for sequencing in the near future, providing an important tool for annotation of centromeres.},

abstract = {?-Satellite is a family of tandemly repeated sequences found at all normal human centromeres. In addition to its significance for understanding centromere function, ?-satellite is also a model for concerted evolution, as ?-satellite repeats are more similar within a species than between species. There are two types of ?-satellite in the human genome; while both are made up of ∼171-bp monomers, they can be distinguished by whether monomers are arranged in extremely homogeneous higher-order, multimeric repeat units or exist as more divergent monomeric ?-satellite that lacks any multimeric periodicity. In this study, as a model to examine the genomic and evolutionary relationships between these two types, we have focused on the chromosome 17 centromeric region that has reached both higher-order and monomeric ?-satellite in the human genome assembly. Monomeric and higher-order ?-satellites on chromosome 17 are phylogenetically distinct, consistent with a model in which higher-order evolved independently of monomeric ?-satellite. Comparative analysis between human chromosome 17 and the orthologous chimpanzee chromosome indicates that monomeric ?-satellite is evolving at approximately the same rate as the adjacent non-?-satellite DNA. However, higher-order ?-satellite is less conserved, suggesting different evolutionary rates for the two types of ?-satellite},

abstract = {Plant genomes, and eukaryotic genomes in general, are typically repetitive, polyploid and heterozygous, which complicates genome assembly. The short read lengths of early Sanger and current next-generation sequencing platforms hinder assembly through complex repeat regions, and many draft and reference genomes are fragmented, lacking skewed GC and repetitive intergenic sequences, which are gaining importance due to projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). Here we report the whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the desiccation-tolerant grass Oropetium thomaeum. Using only single-molecule real-time sequencing, which generates long ({\textgreater}16 kilobases) reads with random errors, we assembled 99{\%} (244 megabases) of the Oropetium genome into 625 contigs with an N50 length of 2.4 megabases. Oropetium is an example of a 'near-complete' draft genome which includes gapless coverage over gene space as well as intergenic sequences such as centromeres, telomeres, transposable elements and rRNA clusters that are typically unassembled in draft genomes. Oropetium has 28,466 protein-coding genes and 43{\%} repeat sequences, yet with 30{\%} more compact euchromatic regions it is the smallest known grass genome. The Oropetium genome demonstrates the utility of single-molecule real-time sequencing for assembling high-quality plant and other eukaryotic genomes, and serves as a valuable resource for the plant comparative genomics community.},

abstract = {The centromere is a chromosomal locus responsible for the faithful segregation of genetic material during cell division. It has become evident that centromeres can be established literally on any DNA sequence, and the possible synergy between DNA sequences and the most prominent centromere identifiers, protein components, and epigenetic marks remains uncertain. However, some evolutionary preferences seem to exist, and long-term established centromeres are frequently formed on long arrays of satellite DNAs and/or transposable elements. Recent progress in understanding functional centromere sequences is based largely on the high-resolution DNA mapping of sequences that interact with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, the most reliable marker of active centromeres. In addition, sequence assembly and mapping of large repetitive centromeric regions, as well as comparative genome analyses offer insight into their complex organization and evolution. The rapidly advancing field of transcription in centromere regions highlights the functional importance of centromeric transcripts. Here, we comprehensively review the current state of knowledge on the composition and functionality of DNA sequences underlying active centromeres and discuss their contribution to the functioning of different centromere types in higher eukaryotes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Long arrays of near-identical tandem repeats are a common feature of centromeric and subtelomeric regions in complex genomes. These sequences present a source of repeat structure diversity that is commonly ignored by standard genomic tools. Unlike reads shorter than the underlying repeat structure that rely on indirect inference methods, e.g. assembly, long reads allow direct inference of satellite higher order repeat structure. To automate characterization of local centromeric tandem repeat sequence variation we have designed Alpha-CENTAURI (ALPHA satellite CENTromeric AUtomated Repeat Identification), that takes advantage of Pacific Bioscience long-reads from whole-genome sequencing datasets. By operating on reads prior to assembly, our approach provides a more comprehensive set of repeat-structure variants and is not impacted by rearrangements or sequence underrepresentation due to misassembly. RESULTS We demonstrate the utility of Alpha-CENTAURI in characterizing repeat structure for alpha satellite containing reads in the hydatidiform mole (CHM1, haploid-like) genome. The pipeline is designed to report local repeat organization summaries for each read, thereby monitoring rearrangements in repeat units, shifts in repeat orientation and sites of array transition into non-satellite DNA, typically defined by transposable element insertion. We validate the method by showing consistency with existing centromere high order repeat references. Alpha-CENTAURI can, in principle, run on any sequence data, offering a method to generate a sequence repeat resolution that could be readily performed using consensus sequences available for other satellite families in genomes without high-quality reference assemblies.

abstract = {Zebrafish have become a popular organism for the study of vertebrate gene function. The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that approximately 70{\%} of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.},

abstract = {Kinetochores assemble on distinct 'centrochromatin' containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A and interspersed nucleosomes dimethylated on H3K4 (H3K4me2). Little is known about how the chromatin environment at active centromeres governs centromeric structure and function. Here, we report that centrochromatin resembles K4-K36 domains found in the body of some actively transcribed housekeeping genes. By tethering the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), we specifically depleted H3K4me2, a modification thought to have a role in transcriptional memory, from the kinetochore of a synthetic human artificial chromosome (HAC). H3K4me2 depletion caused kinetochores to suffer a rapid loss of transcription of the underlying $\alpha$-satellite DNA and to no longer efficiently recruit HJURP, the CENP-A chaperone. Kinetochores depleted of H3K4me2 remained functional in the short term, but were defective in incorporation of CENP-A, and were gradually inactivated. Our data provide a functional link between the centromeric chromatin, $\alpha$-satellite transcription, maintenance of CENP-A levels and kinetochore stability.},

Proposed a model that H3K4me2 and trasncription of satellite play a role in incorporation of CENP-A by HJURP.},

Centromeric proteins, including the centromeric histone centromere protein A (CENP-A), define the site of centromeric chromatin and kinetochore assembly. In many organisms, centromeres are located in or near regions of repetitive DNA. However, some atypical centromeres spontaneously form on unique sequences. These neocentromeres, or new centromeres, were first identified in humans, but have since been described in other organisms. Neocentromeres are functionally and structurally similar to endogenous centromeres, but lack the added complication of underlying repetitive sequences.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA sequencing technologies deviate from the ideal uniform distribution of reads. These biases impair scientific and medical applications. Accordingly, we have developed computational methods for discovering, describing and measuring bias.

RESULTS: We applied these methods to the Illumina, Ion Torrent, Pacific Biosciences and Complete Genomics sequencing platforms, using data from human and from a set of microbes with diverse base compositions. As in previous work, library construction conditions significantly influence sequencing bias. Pacific Biosciences coverage levels are the least biased, followed by Illumina, although all technologies exhibit error-rate biases in high- and low-GC regions and at long homopolymer runs. The GC-rich regions prone to low coverage include a number of human promoters, so we therefore catalog 1,000 that were exceptionally resistant to sequencing. Our results indicate that combining data from two technologies can reduce coverage bias if the biases in the component technologies are complementary and of similar magnitude. Analysis of Illumina data representing 120-fold coverage of a well-studied human sample reveals that 0.20{\%} of the autosomal genome was covered at less than 10{\%} of the genome-wide average. Excluding locations that were similar to known bias motifs or likely due to sample-reference variations left only 0.045{\%} of the autosomal genome with unexplained poor coverage.

CONCLUSIONS: The assays presented in this paper provide a comprehensive view of sequencing bias, which can be used to drive laboratory improvements and to monitor production processes. Development guided by these assays should result in improved genome assemblies and better coverage of biologically important loci.},

abstract = {AIM: To use a novel computational approach, Key-string Algorithm (KSA), for the identification and analysis of arbitrarily large repetitive sequences and higher-order repeats (HORs) in noncoding DNA. This approach is based on the use of key string that plays a role of an arbitrarily constructed "computer enzyme".

METHOD: A cluster of novel KSA-related methods was introduced and developed on the basis of a combination of computations on a very modest scale, by eye inspection and graphical display of results of analysis. Sequence analysis software was developed, containing seven programs for KSA-related analyses. This approach was demonstrated in the case study of alpha satellites and HORs in the human genetic sequence AC017075.8 (193277 bp) from the centromeric region of human chromosome 7. The KSA segmentation method was applied by using DCCGTTT, GTA, and TTTC key strings.

RESULTS: Fifty-five copies of 2734-bp 16mer HORs were identified and investigated, and a start-string TTTTTTAAAAA was identified. The HOR-matrix was constructed and employed for graphical display of mutations. KSA identification of HORs in AC017075.8 was compared with that of RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder, which identified alpha monomers in AC017075.8, but not the HORs. On the basis of KSA study, the centromere folding was described as an effect of HORs and super-HORs (3 x 2734 bp) in AC017075.8. The following novel computational KSA-based methods, easy-to-use and intended for computational "pedestrians", were demonstrated: color-HOR diagram, KSA-divergence method, 171-bp subsequence-convergence diagram, and total frequency distribution of the key-string subsequence lengths. The results were supplemented by Fast Fourier Transform, employing a novel mapping of symbolic genomic sequence into a numerical sequence.

CONCLUSION: The KSA approach offers a simple and robust framework for a wide range of investigations of large repetitive sequences and HORs, involving a very modest scope of computations that can be carried out by using a PC. As the KSA method is HOR-oriented, the identification of HORs is even easier than the identification of underlying alpha monomer itself. This approach provides an easy identification of point mutations, insertions, and deletions, with respect to consensus. This may be useful in a wide range of investigations and applied in forensic medicine, medical diagnosis of malignant diseases, biological evolution, and paleontology.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: GenBank data are at present lacking alpha satellite higher-order repeat (HOR) annotation. Furthermore, exact HOR consensus lengths have not been reported so far. Given the fast growth of sequence databases in the centromeric region, it is of increasing interest to have efficient tools for computational identification and analysis of HORs from known sequences. RESULTS: We develop a graphical user interface method, ColorHOR, for fast computational identification of HORs in a given genomic sequence, without requiring a priori information on the composition of the genomic sequence. ColorHOR is based on an extension of the key-string algorithm and provides a color representation of the order and orientation of HORs. For the key string, we use a robust 6 bp string from a consensus alpha satellite and its representative nature is tested. ColorHOR algorithm provides a direct visual identification of HORs (direct and/or reverse complement). In more detail, we first illustrate the ColorHOR results for human chromosome 1. Using ColorHOR we determine for the first time the HOR annotation of the GenBank sequence of the whole human genome. In addition to some HORs, corresponding to those determined previously biochemically, we find new HORs in chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 19. For the first time, we determine exact consensus lengths of HORs in 10 chromosomes. We propose that the HOR assignment obtained by using ColorHOR be included into the GenBank database.},

abstract = {The centromeric regions of human chromosomes are characterized by diverged chromosome-specific subsets of a tandemly repeated DNA family, alpha satellite, which is based on a fundamental monomer repeat unit approximately 171 bp in length. We have compared the nucleotide sequences of 44 alphoid monomers derived from cloned representatives of the multimeric higher-order repeat units of human chromosomes 1, 11, 17, and X. The 44 monomers exhibit an average 16{\%} divergence from a consensus alphoid sequence, and can be assigned to five distinct homology groups based on patterns of sequence substitutions and gaps relative to the consensus. Approximately half of the overall sequence divergence can be accounted for by sequence changes specific to a particular homology group; the remaining divergence appears to be independent of the five groups and is randomly distributed, both within and between chromosomal subsets. The data are consistent with the proposal that the contemporary tandem arrays on chromosomes 1, 11, 17, and X derive from a common multimeric repeat, consisting of one monomer each from the five homology groups. The sequence comparisons suggest that this pentameric repeat must have spread to these four chromosomal locations many millions of years ago, since which time evolution of the four, now chromosome-specific, alpha satellite subsets has been essentially independent.},

LINE1 repeat elements cover one-third of the X chromosome, with a distribution that is consistent with their proposed role as way stations in the process of X-chromosome inactivation. We found 1,098 genes in the sequence, of which 99 encode proteins expressed in testis and in various tumour types. A disproportionately high number of mendelian diseases are documented for the X chromosome.

While there is strong evidence supporting the association of some subfamilies of alpha satellite with centromere function, the basis for establishing whether a given alpha satellite sequence is or is not designated a functional centromere is unknown, and attempts to understand the role of particular sequence features in establishing centromere identity have been limited by the near identity and repetitive nature of satellite sequences. Utilizing a broadly applicable experimental approach to test sequence competency for centromere specification, we have carried out a genomic and epigenetic functional analysis of endogenous human centromere sequences available in the current human genome assembly. The data support a model in which functionally competent sequences confer an opportunity for centromere specification, integrating genomic and epigenetic signals and promoting the concept of context-dependent centromere inheritance.},

abstract = {The human genome sequence remains incomplete, with multimegabase-sized gaps representing the endogenous centromeres and other heterochromatic regions. Available sequence-based studies within these sites in the genome have demonstrated a role in centromere function and chromosome pairing, necessary to ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. A common genomic feature of these regions is the enrichment of long arrays of near-identical tandem repeats, known as satellite DNAs, which offer a limited number of variant sites to differentiate individual repeat copies across millions of bases. This substantial sequence homogeneity challenges available assembly strategies and, as a result, centromeric regions are omitted from ongoing genomic studies. To address this problem, we utilize monomer sequence and ordering information obtained from whole-genome shotgun reads to model two haploid human satellite arrays on chromosomes X and Y, resulting in an initial characterization of 3.83 Mb of centromeric DNA within an individual genome. To further expand the utility of each centromeric reference sequence model, we evaluate sites within the arrays for short-read mappability and chromosome specificity. Because satellite DNAs evolve in a concerted manner, we use these centromeric assemblies to assess the extent of sequence variation among 366 individuals from distinct human populations. We thus identify two satellite array variants in both X and Y centromeres, as determined by array length and sequence composition. This study provides an initial sequence characterization of a regional centromere and establishes a foundation to extend genomic characterization to these sites as well as to other repeat-rich regions within complex genomes.},

abstract = {An understanding of how centromeric transition regions are organized is a critical aspect of chromosome structure and function; however, the sequence context of these regions has been difficult to resolve on the basis of the draft genome sequence. We present a detailed analysis of the structure and assembly of all human pericentromeric regions (5 megabases). Most chromosome arms (35 out of 43) show a gradient of dwindling transcriptional diversity accompanied by an increasing number of interchromosomal duplications in proximity to the centromere. At least 30{\%} of the centromeric transition region structure originates from euchromatic gene-containing segments of DNA that were duplicatively transposed towards pericentromeric regions at a rate of six-seven events per million years during primate evolution. This process has led to the formation of a minimum of 28 new transcripts by exon exaptation and exon shuffling, many of which are primarily expressed in the testis. The distribution of these duplicated segments is nonrandom among pericentromeric regions, suggesting that some regions have served as preferential acceptors of euchromatic DNA.},

abstract = {Advances in human genomics have accelerated studies in evolution, disease, and cellular regulation. However, centromere sequences, defining the chromosomal interface with spindle microtubules, remain largely absent from ongoing genomic studies and disconnected from functional, genome-wide analyses. This disparity results from the challenge of predicting the linear order of multi-megabase-sized regions that are composed almost entirely of near-identical satellite DNA. Acknowledging these challenges, the field of human centromere genomics possesses the potential to rapidly advance given the availability of individual, or personalized, genome projects matched with the promise of long-read sequencing technologies. Here I review the current genomic model of human centromeres in consideration of those studies involving functional datasets that examine the role of sequence in centromere identity.},

abstract = {The centromere is the chromosomal locus essential for chromosome inheritance and genome stability. Human centromeres are located at repetitive alpha satellite DNA arrays that compose approximately 5{\%} of the genome. Contiguous alpha satellite DNA sequence is absent from the assembled reference genome, limiting current understanding of centromere organization and function. Here, we review the progress in centromere genomics spanning the discovery of the sequence to its molecular characterization and the work done during the Human Genome Project era to elucidate alpha satellite structure and sequence variation. We discuss exciting recent advances in alpha satellite sequence assembly that have provided important insight into the abundance and complex organization of this sequence on human chromosomes. In light of these new findings, we offer perspectives for future studies of human centromere assembly and function.},

@article{Melters2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Centromeres are essential for chromosome segregation, yet their DNA sequences evolve rapidly. In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres contain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance, very little is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share common properties between different species across different phyla. We used bioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species using publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. RESULTS: Our methods are compatible with all current sequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to find tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp. We assumed that the most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA, which was true for most species whose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a general property of genomes. High-copy centromere tandem repeats were found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were highly variable in sequence composition and length. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence conservation beyond approximately 50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an overall lack of sequence conservation, centromere tandem repeats from diverse species showed similar modes of evolution. CONCLUSIONS: While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically determined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at centromeres of both animal and plant genomes. This suggests a functional role for such repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across chromosomes.},
