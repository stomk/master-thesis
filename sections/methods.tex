\subsection*{centromeric repeat genomic abundance estimation}
PacBio subreads were first filtered with the criteria that read length $>$1 kb and base quality average over the all bases $>$10. The filtered subreads were then scanned by RepeatMasker with a sensitive setting using the medaka representative centromeric satellite monomer sequence as a custom library. Genomic fraction of the medaka centromeric satellite for each strain was estimated by the ratio of total amount of masked centromeric satellite in the total length of the filtered subreads.
